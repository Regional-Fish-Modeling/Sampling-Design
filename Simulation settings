Response variables
  adult (total (sum of YOY and adult) and YOY may be pursued later)

Range of CI for defining statistical significance: 
  95%, 85% and 75%

Settings to vary in simulations
  nSites <- c(50, 100, 200)
  nYears <- c(5, 10, 20)
  annualDec <- c(1.0, 2.5, 5.0)
  
Matrix of simulations for task assignment
  simMat <- expand.grid(nSites, nYears, annualDec)
  names(simMat) <- c("nSites","nYears","perAnnualDecline")
  simMat$person <- NA

Number of simulations per setting: 250 or 500???
