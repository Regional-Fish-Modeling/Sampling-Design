Settings to vary in simulations
- Number of sites (e.g., 50, 100 & 200)
- Number of years (e.g., 5, 10 & 20)
- Percent annual decline (e.g., 1.0, 2.5 & 10.0)

Response variables
- YOY, adult and total (sum of YOY and adult)?

Range of CI for defining statistical significance
- e.g. 95%, 80% and 70% ???
